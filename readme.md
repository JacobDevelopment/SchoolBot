# Tickster
> This bot was developed for two major purposes that a lot of moderation bots seem to lack:
> * An efficient, easy-to-understand ticketing system.
> * A reporting system that can help identify members of a server that are *misbehaving*.
> * This bot does not provide over-saturated discord commands (*e.g. ban/kick/mute*). The purpose
> is to provide commands/fully functioning systems that coincide with other moderation bots to help make users lives easier within a discord server.
> * There is <b>no</b> website dashboard that you have to link your discord account/server to, everything can be properly setup within the server itself. No outside configuration.
